# In Linux, the apropos command is used to search the manual page descriptions for a keyword. It helps you find commands related to a specific topic.
# For example ,If you want to find commands related to "network," you would use:

apropos network > 01_apropos_output.txt

# This will list all the commands and descriptions that include the word "network."
